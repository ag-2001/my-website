      Welcome to my website! My name is Akhila Gundavelli and I am a senior at Evergreen Valley High School. Some of my hobbies include Kuchipudi, an Indian Classical Dance, which I have done for the past nine years, and Tae Kwon Do, which I have done for the past five years. I recently got my First Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and hope to pursue the martial art in college. My dream is to become a biomedical engineer, since I really enjoy biology and computer science.
